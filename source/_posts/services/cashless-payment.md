  Our cashless payment system can greatly limit or eliminate on-site cash
  handling, reducing potential loss and providing valuable insight into food and
  beverage sales. Visitors can top up money on their wristbands prior to the
  start of the event. And during the event automated top-ups can also be
  authorised making queuing at ATMs no longer necessary. The PlayPass cashless
  payments system runs completely offline to ensure constant cashless
  transactions. Online connection, however, is required for real-time reporting.
